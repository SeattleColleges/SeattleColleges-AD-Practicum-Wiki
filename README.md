Seattle Colleges – Application Development Practicum Wiki

Welcome to the official centralized knowledge base for the Seattle Colleges Application Development Practicum.
This repository hosts the Practicum Wiki, which contains all documentation, onboarding materials, processes, team structures, and project information used throughout the program.

This repo exists to replace scattered Notion pages and ensure that all students, PMs, and leads have a single source of truth for Practicum operations.
